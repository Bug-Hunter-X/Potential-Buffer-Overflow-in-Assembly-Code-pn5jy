```assembly
mov ecx, [ebx + 8] ; Assume the size of the buffer is at [ebx + 8]
mov eax, [ebx + 4]
add eax, 10
cmp ecx, eax ;Check if addition result is within bounds
ja overflow ; Jump if the addition overflows the buffer
mov [ebx], eax
jmp end
overflow:
; Handle overflow appropriately, for example:
halt ; Stop execution or signal an error
end:
